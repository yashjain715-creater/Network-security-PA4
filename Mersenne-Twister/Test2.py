Chi-Square Frequency Test for Uniformity
Null hypothesis:  Our numbers distributed uniformly on the interval [0, 1).
In the chi-square test, we test to determine whether our numbersnare uniformly distributed on the interval [0,1).

Formula is: "sum[ (observed-val - expected-val)^2 / expected val ], from 0 to num_samples"
This gives us a number which we can test against a chi-square value table.

Also the degrees of freedom:  df = num_samples - 1

Compare the critical value from here:
